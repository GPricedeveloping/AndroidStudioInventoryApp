This is a full-fledged Android app that exposes login authentication, SQLite local data storage, and SMS permission management. It enables users to register or log in, add or remove items to/from a locally cached list, and send a test SMS message upon permission authorization.

The UI is user-focused in design with plain inputs, circular buttons, and easy-to-use layout. Design of each screen was made as minimal and readable as possible in order to ensure an uninterrupted user experience.

Development consisted of mapping front-end XML screens to back-end Java classes and was accomplished using modular design for maintainability. SQLite was used for item data and user login storage, and Android's runtime permission system was utilized for secure processing of SMS capability.

Testing on the Android Emulator confirmed that login, data storage, and SMS worked fine even if permissions were not accepted.

I enhanced my understanding of mobile application development, debugging, and best coding practices from this project. It provided valuable hands-on experience in creating fully functional Android apps from UI design to functional release.
